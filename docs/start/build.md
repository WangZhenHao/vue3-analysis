# VitePress ðŸ’™ StackBlitz

Hi there :wave: This is a demo running VitePress within your **browser tab**!

## Powered by Vite

VitePress uses Vite under the hood. This means:

- Instant server start
- Lightning fast HMR
- Optimized builds

## Markdown-Centered

So you can focus more on writing. Powered by MarkdownIt. Comes with many [built-in extensions](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown), and you can use Vue features in Markdown too!
